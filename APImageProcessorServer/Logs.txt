21 Dec - Implemented concurrent client handling capability on server by using a separate queue for each client and saving queue for clients in a map. Server can now handle concurrent requests, although order of receiving payload is not always the same. Need to implement sequencing by sending a sequence number with each payload, storing them at server in a map of sequence_num->image_data, then iterating through i=0 to number of payloads and appending value of each entry to the imageDataString.

22 Dec - Added sequence number to payload so order is maintained while re-constructing image.
22 Dec - Stopped enqueueing last payload size. Wasn't using it, and it was somehow intermittently pushing an empty message into the queue.
